# My Data Science & AI Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a collection of end-to-end projects that demonstrate my skills in data science, machine learning, and AI application development.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder, complete with its own code and detailed `README.md` file explaining the business problem, technical solution, and results.
